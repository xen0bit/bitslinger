## Notes

##### Probably about bitslinger.

 * `sudo watch cat /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue`
   * for monitoring nfqueue dropped packets etc


 * **protobuf** ~~maybe~~, almost definitely


 * pf_ring maybe



 * named pipes? ~~_probably a good idea_~~
   * I'm not sure we need this, everything happens within golang anyway


 * write better notes
   * probably pre-optimizing here tbh


## Questions

  * Reasoning behind using the raw table instead of the nat table?
