## Notes

##### Probably about bitslinger.

 * `sudo watch cat /proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue`
   * for monitoring nfqueue dropped packets etc

 * **protobuf** ~~maybe~~, almost definitely

 * pf_ring maybe

 * named pipes? _probably a good idea_

 * write better notes
   * probably pre-optimizing here tbh
